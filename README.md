# Ansible Role: firefox

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/maxbachmann/role-firefox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/maxbachmann/role-firefox)

An Ansible Role that installs Firefox, the firefox addons mentioned in [Firefox Kompendium](https://www.kuketz-blog.de/firefox-ein-browser-fuer-datenschutzbewusste-firefox-kompendium-teil1/), the user.js from [Ghacks](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js), some offline fonts so remote fonts are not required and some search keywords for the Url-Bar. The role is compatible with RHEL/CentOS, Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu.
Be aware that while this config blocks a lot of tracking, which helps bot with privacy and security it give the user a very unique fingerprint aswell. Thats why itÂ´s still recommended to use the [TOR Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) for normal surfing and this firefox config for functions that websites that require a login (e.g. forums, social media, online banking or online shopping).
